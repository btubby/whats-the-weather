live locationsweather 
======================

A live weather report for a given location.

TODO/possible improvements
--------------------------------
- convert codebase to typescript
- results should show country as well as city - London, UK vs London, CA for example
- customise the error messages from the API
- handle cities that occur in multiple places, eg 'San Jose' - look at getting the API to return a list and offer a choice
- make more responsive - look at introducing breakpoints
- deal with spelling mistakes/typos in input - Can’t find ‘Kondon’, did you mean London?
- look at the typography used
